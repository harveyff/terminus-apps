    https://docs.olares.com/use-cases/openclaw.html#upgrade-notes

    Highlights & New Features:
    External Secrets Management: A complete workflow for secrets (audit, configure, apply, reload) with runtime snapshot activation.
    ACP/Thread-bound Agents: ACP agents are now first-class runtimes for thread sessions.
    Agents Routing CLI: New openclaw agents bindings/bind/unbindcommands for account-scoped route management.

    Delivery & Queue Reliability: Enhanced retry backoff, draining logic, and cron agent timeout handling.
    Configuration & Doctor: Improved validation and repair for dmPolicy: "allowlist"configs to prevent silent DM drops.
