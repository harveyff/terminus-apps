  upgradeDescription: |
    upgrade to version 2026.2.25
    
    Important:
    This update introduced a breaking change, if your Control UI fails to start after the upgrade, refer to following doc to resolve the issue.
    https://docs.olares.com/use-cases/openclaw.html#upgrade-notes

    New Features & Improvements
    - Android & UI Enhancements: Improved streaming delivery and markdown rendering in the native Android chat UI. Added a mobile-optimized stacked layout for action buttons on small screens.
    
    - Branding Update: Replaced legacy bot.moltidentifiers with ai.openclawacross documentation, iOS app surfaces, and helper scripts.
    
    Configuration & Behavior Changes
    - Heartbeat Policy: Replaced the heartbeat.dmtoggle with a clearer agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicysetting (allowor block).
    -  Breaking Change: The default for heartbeat direct message delivery has been reverted to allow. To maintain the blocking behavior from v2026.2.24, you must explicitly set agents.defaults.heartbeat.directPolicy: "block".
    
    And many fixes and improvements.
