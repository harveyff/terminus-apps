    Qwen3.5 represents a significant leap forward, integrating breakthroughs in multimodal learning, architectural efficiency, reinforcement learning scale, and global accessibility to empower developers and enterprises with unprecedented capability and efficiency.

    Qwen3.5 features the following enhancement:

    Unified Vision-Language Foundation: Early fusion training on multimodal tokens achieves cross-generational parity with Qwen3 and outperforms Qwen3-VL models across reasoning, coding, agents, and visual understanding benchmarks.

    Efficient Hybrid Architecture: Gated Delta Networks combined with sparse Mixture-of-Experts deliver high-throughput inference with minimal latency and cost overhead.

    Scalable RL Generalization: Reinforcement learning scaled across million-agent environments with progressively complex task distributions for robust real-world adaptability.

    Global Linguistic Coverage: Expanded support to 201 languages and dialects, enabling inclusive, worldwide deployment with nuanced cultural and regional understanding.

    Next-Generation Training Infrastructure: Near-100% multimodal training efficiency compared to text-only training and asynchronous RL frameworks supporting massive-scale agent scaffolds and environment orchestration.
